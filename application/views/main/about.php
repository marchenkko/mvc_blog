            <p>Many people think that an entrepreneur is a successful person who just successfully invested money in some idea or business. But in practice, it is not luck that is decisive, but the personal qualities of a businessman, his business acumen, the ability to see and benefit where others would pass by. In addition, other skills are very important: the ability to work in a team and set tasks for colleagues, establishing partnerships, a competent approach to planning, etc.</p>
            <p>No one is born with ready-made knowledge and skills - we learn everything necessary gradually. Applicants often ask the question: “Why study business?”. Profile education at the faculties of business management is necessary for future entrepreneurs in order to gain knowledge on how to manage an enterprise and its finances, how to organize and motivate employees, and much more, without which a modern business simply cannot work and generate income.</p>
